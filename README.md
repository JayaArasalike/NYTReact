This project is deployed at: https://nytreact-ja.herokuapp.com/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. This app is created with React components, works with helper functions, and utilizes the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on user searches. I have also used Node, Express for server side programming and MongoDB as database. After searching articles, users can save the results and also can delete the saved articles, if they are no longer interested in it.

This project has following dependencies installed.
1. express
2. mongoose
3. axios (for API calls)
4. body-parser
5. bluebird
6. react
7. react-dom
8. react-scripts
